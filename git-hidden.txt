#GIT_HIDDEN 1.1 - Intro to git hidden folder
Hey Chris from Codify Academy here, in this video I want to show you how Git tracks your project versions.

#GIT_HIDDEN 1.2 - What is the .git folder
I want to give you some inside knowledge on Git and fix a small issue from earlier.
As developers we use Git to track different versions of a program and store it on GitHub.


#GIT_HIDDEN 1.3 - Why is the .git folder there
When you use git init inside of a folder a .git hidden folder is created,
this folder is used track your commits to GitHub


#GIT_HIDDEN 1.4 - What happens if I get rid of .git folder?
So you might be asking what happens if we delete this .git hidden folder?
Then this folder will no longer be connected to GitHub, you wont be able to make changes and upload.
Normally you only delete the .git hidden folder if you have an error that you can't fix and its the first commit of a project.

#GIT_HIDDEN 1.5 - Remove .git from template
Another reasons is what we need to do, So if you make a copy of a project that has the .git hidden folder inside, you wont be able to add the new project to a new project repo on GitHub you see "Reinitialized existing Git", so to fix this issue we delete the .git hidden folder from inside of the template folder.
and reason is we want to be able to create a new repo on GitHub, for each project, and if we don't delete it, then we wont be able to commit any of our projects made from the template to GitHub.



#GIT_HIDDEN 1.6 - How to display hidden files .git from template
We need to display the hidden files so you can see these folders
on PC, its easy, open a folder go to view and click show hidden files. - to hide them again just check off the same box.
On Mac you have to type this command into your terminal - defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles -boolean true ; killall Finder.
that will be in the description
as long as you're using 10.8 or later it will work, other wise just google your OS version. and to hide them again retype the same command with FALSE instead of true. I'll use the up arrow key and adjust mine.

Now Delete the .git folder from your original template.


#GIT_HIDDEN 1.6 - Outro to git hidden folder
Once thats done you can make copies of the template and you'll be able to add those new projects to repos on GitHub!
Try it out, make a copy of your template and cd to the folder, the try git init you should see "initializing a new repo" instead of "Reinitialized existing Git" now, if not just rewind the video and try again.
